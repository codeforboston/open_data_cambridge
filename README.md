## Open Data on GitHub

Hi! This is a copy of open maps data shared by the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
It is converted, reprojected, curated, and maintained by local volunteers, and <strong>might not be
accurate or up-to-date</strong>. Use at your own risk.

## Download

Use the 'Download ZIP' button or
<a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/open_data_cambridge/archive/master.zip">this link</a> to download all of the data in a .ZIP

Click on folders and files to view maps of each individual file. Then click the 'Raw' button to download the data in GeoJSON format.

## GeoJSON

GitHub recognizes our GeoJSON files and creates interactive maps
<a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/open_data_cambridge/blob/master/Transit/SubwayStations.geojson">like this one</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/open_data_cambridge/blob/master/Hydro/Wetlands.geojson">this one</a>
for most files.  A few large files, such as Buildings and Parcel layers, do not create their maps, but they are included in the dataset
and you can view them using the 'Raw' button.

## Report Issues and Update Data

If you notice a problem with the data, you can report an issue on this site using <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/open_data_cambridge/issues/new">the New Issue form</a>.

You can also click 'Edit' on any GeoJSON file to make a fork/copy on your own account, make changes, and suggest that they get adopted here.
